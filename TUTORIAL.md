## Introduction

In this tutorial you can learn how to build web application using React.js, build and deploy a smart contract on the Near Blockchain and connect web app with the smart contract to have a working web application which will interact with the smart contract.

## Prerequisites

To prepare the development environment, make sure you have installed [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 12+, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and the latest [near-cli](https://github.com/near/near-cli)

You also need to create a testnet account, go to the [testnet wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/) and create one, it's easy and free:

## Getting Started with the project

The easiest way to get started is using [npx - Node Package Execute](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)

### Install `npx` as a global dependency

```
npm install -g npx
```

### Generate starter project

Let's generate the new project. Go to a directory where you want to have your project in the terminal. In our case we will be using home directory.

For near dapps there is a `npx` binary [create-near-app](https://github.com/near/create-near-app). It has some options to choose what type of frontend you are going to use and also what type of smart contract you are going to use. Here are the option you can use:

```
âžœ  ~ npx create-near-app -h
create-near-app <projectDir>

Create a new NEAR project

Options:
  --version   Show version number                                      [boolean]
  --frontend  template to use
            [choices: "vanilla", "react", "vue", "angular"] [default: "vanilla"]
  --contract  language for smart contract
                 [choices: "assemblyscript", "rust"] [default: "assemblyscript"]
  --help      Show help                                                [boolean]

Examples:
  create-near-app new-app  Create a project called "new-app"
```

For this tutorial we are going to use `react` as a frontend and `assemblyscript` as a smart contract.

Open terminal and execute the command:

```
npx create-near-app near-tutorial --frontend=react --contract=assemblyscript
```

Wait a bit to download everything and when it finish you will see something like this:
![New project generated](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ev6hlxvto6dl7ujtklud.png)

In general our new project is ready to be started, the only thing you still need is to login in your near testnet account you should have create before. To do this open the terminal and call:

```
near login
```

It should open the browser where you approve login, after that you are ready to interact with the near blockchain using `near cli.

That's it we have created our project, now we can get hands dirty in the code. Open the project in you favourite IDE, the recommended option is using free [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/):

```
cd near-tutorial
code .
```

## Project structure

![New project structure](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/06jymp2k3m9k89ycxtdl.png)

Our newly created project has several main places:

- `src` - React source code
- `contract` - Smart contract source code
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and running scripts
- `Readme.md` - Project documentation and development tips
- `neardev` - Configuration for smart contract development

## Running the project

First of all we need to install dependencies using `yarn` command:

```
yarn
```

It can take some minutes depending on your network, be patient :)

After that we can already run the project in the dev environment. You can use one simple command:

```
yarn dev
```

After a couple of seconds you should see something similar in your terminal and it should also open the app in your default browser:
![Yarn dev result](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ufw8uo055yvrms0qzelw.png)

The app url http://localhost:1234/ opened in browser should look like this:
![Browser View](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wycamwk5028e6wy2de2u.png)

In the dev console you can also see that you dev smart contract was deployed to the blockchain, it starts with `dev-` and have some random numbers, in our case its `dev-1638480997606-36755974489881`. You can also see the link to the smart contract transaction deployment: https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/7N4BWLVyuo9gXp9sGe8WKXBZEX7iJUq5AvZXAGqoRij1
Opening the link in your terminal will show you similar:
![Smart Contract Transaction](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iqh3hsxo6tq3ptotn1p2.png)

Now let's jump in the browser and test how it works.
Generated project has predefined **greeting** smart contract, you can enter the custom greeting message and it will save it in the smart contract storage, change it to something custom and press save. It should redirect you to the wallet where you can sign the smart contract with your near testnet account.

Press allow to approve transaction:
![Approve transaction](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/erlnb6w7pfy2zu30jpx4.png)

After successful approval you will be redirected back to the ui and will see the new greeting which is loaded from the smart contract:

![Updated greeting](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/duvhz1fo2dffigrojj4w.png)

## It works, let's see how its done

### Smart contract implementation and cli interaction:

Smart contract is located in `contract/assembly/index.ts`:

![Smart contract](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9v97g0vr6xcd257erm83.png)

It has the default message which we saw in the browser right after the opening:

```
const DEFAULT_MESSAGE = 'Hello'
```

And it has two methods `getGreeting(accountId: string)` and `setGreeting(message: string)`

### Mutating method `setGreeting`

```
export function setGreeting(message: string): void {
  const accountId = Context.sender
  // Use logging.log to record logs permanently to the blockchain!
  logging.log(`Saving greeting "${message}" for account "${accountId}"`)
  storage.set(accountId, message)
}
```

As you can see this method contains one argument `message` which was send when we approved the transaction. Inside the method we are extracting a the sender accountId from the `Context` class:

```
const accountId = Context.sender
```

Context is a class provided from the `near-sdk-as` and it has some useful data you may need in your during the development:

![Context class](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y44dm9be05clcgne23sq.png)

You may find the whole class clicking on it in IDE or you can also check it out on [near-sdk-as docs](https://near.github.io/near-sdk-as/classes/_sdk_core_assembly_contract_.context-1.html)

After extracting the accountId we are using another class `storage` and its method `storage.set`:

```
storage.set(accountId, message)
```

Storage is a key-value store that is persisted on the NEAR blockchain. Read the [docs](https://near.github.io/near-sdk-as/classes/_sdk_core_assembly_storage_.storage-1.html) to check all the available methods.

![Storage class](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kz4ine6mpj6abx49vky8.png)

Lets test the method using the `near cli`.

To make is easy we will set the `CONTRACT_NAME` env variable, and to do so we can call `neardev/dev-account.env` which has our contract name inside:

![neardev/dev-account.env](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/woof7nrp18qk3r9h49lm.png)

Call this in the terminal and check if you have exported the variable:

```
source neardev/dev-account.env
echo $CONTRACT_NAME
```

Call result:
![CONTRACT_NAME](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q3am1ltlautaytu8tlh1.png)

One more thing to do is to set our testnet account as `ID` env variable:

```
export ID=your-account.testnet
echo $ID
```

Call result:
![Export $ID](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qws4oyfacqjsqiucsont.png)

If you want to pass a method argument using `near-cli` you can pass a json string afther the contract name.
Now we can set the greeting using `near-cli`:

```
near call $CONTRACT_NAME setGreeting '{"message": "Near CLI Greeting"}' --accountId $ID
```

It will call the smart contract and print you the transaction id:
![setGreeting from CLI](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jfiuryg173o3e85w83zl.png)

### Readonly method `getGreeting`

`getGreeting` method is a readonly method, which mean we cannot use the `context.sender` to get the account id, its only accessible in mutating state calls:

```
export function getGreeting(accountId: string): string | null {
  // This uses raw `storage.get`, a low-level way to interact with on-chain
  // storage for simple contracts.
  // If you have something more complex, check out persistent collections:
  // https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/data-storage#assemblyscript-collection-types
  return storage.get<string>(accountId, DEFAULT_MESSAGE)
}
```

It is doing one call to `storage` to get the greeting from the smart contract storage or the default method, if there is no message in the storage for the account we use. Readonly methods are using `view` instead of `call` we used for `setGreeting`:

```
near view $CONTRACT_NAME getGreeting "{\"accountId\": \"$ID\"}"
```

Boom, we can see the greeting we set in the previous step:

![getGreeting from near cli](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v3f0fzt4z9ufa4qm2rpq.png)

Let go to the browser and refresh the page to verify that our message is also there. If everything goes well you will see this after refresh:
![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zuvsqule4mwwwa5xiz0k.png)

## How React connects with Near

Now lets check how we interact with the Near Blockchain in frontend

In our react application we have `two` configuration files where we connect to the blockchain: `config.js` and `utils.js`:

![React configuration](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2xcng6zvqrcb8ximpvuf.png)

Inside `config.js` we define our contract name, which is also taken from environment variable :

```
const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME ||'near-tutorial'
```

And we also have `getConfig` function with the blockchain configuration for `testnet`, `mainnet` and some other environments:

```
function getConfig(env) {
  switch (env) {

  case 'production':
  case 'mainnet':
    return {
      networkId: 'mainnet',
      nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.mainnet.near.org',
      contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
      walletUrl: 'https://wallet.near.org',
      helperUrl: 'https://helper.mainnet.near.org',
      explorerUrl: 'https://explorer.mainnet.near.org',
    }
  case 'development':
  case 'testnet':
    return {
      networkId: 'testnet',
      nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.testnet.near.org',
      contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
      walletUrl: 'https://wallet.testnet.near.org',
      helperUrl: 'https://helper.testnet.near.org',
      explorerUrl: 'https://explorer.testnet.near.org',
    }
  ...
}
```

The next file is `utils.js` where we use the config from `config.js`, wand the main is `initContract()` method, where we connect to the blockchain `rpc` and list all the available methods in our contract:

```
import { connect, Contract, keyStores, WalletConnection } from 'near-api-js'
import getConfig from './config'

const nearConfig = getConfig(process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development')

// Initialize contract & set global variables
export async function initContract() {
  // Initialize connection to the NEAR testnet
  const near = await connect(Object.assign({ deps: { keyStore: new keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore() } }, nearConfig))

  // Initializing Wallet based Account. It can work with NEAR testnet wallet that
  // is hosted at https://wallet.testnet.near.org
  window.walletConnection = new WalletConnection(near)

  // Getting the Account ID. If still unauthorized, it's just empty string
  window.accountId = window.walletConnection.getAccountId()

  // Initializing our contract APIs by contract name and configuration
  window.contract = await new Contract(window.walletConnection.account(), nearConfig.contractName, {
    // View methods are read only. They don't modify the state, but usually return some value.
    viewMethods: ['getGreeting'],
    // Change methods can modify the state. But you don't receive the returned value when called.
    changeMethods: ['setGreeting'],
  })
}
```

We expand the global `window` object with the methods we will be using to interact with the blockchain and our smart contract. And here we also list `viewMethods` which we were calling with `near view` and `changeMethods` which we were calling with `near call`. So whenever you add new methods to your contract you have to update this file and list all the methods in the appropriate section, so that you can also use them later in your React Components.

In `src/App.js` you can see how the contract is used:

```ts
// The useEffect hook can be used to fire side-effects during render
// Learn more: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
React.useEffect(
  () => {
    // in this case, we only care to query the contract when signed in
    if (window.walletConnection.isSignedIn()) {
      // window.contract is set by initContract in index.js
      window.contract
        .getGreeting({ accountId: window.accountId })
        .then((greetingFromContract) => {
          setGreeting(greetingFromContract);
        });
    }
  },

  // The second argument to useEffect tells React when to re-run the effect
  // Use an empty array to specify "only run on first render"
  // This works because signing into NEAR Wallet reloads the page
  []
);
```

## Making Changes

So now when we know how everything is connected to each other let's make it ours by making some changes.

### Updating Smart Contract

Let's expand our smart contract with some properties, like date when the most recent greeting has been set.

In VSCode open `contract/assemble/index.ts` and add replace `setGreeting` method with the following:

```
export function setGreeting(message: string): void {
  const accountId = Context.sender;
  const timestamp = Context.blockTimestamp;
  // Use logging.log to record logs permanently to the blockchain!
  logging.log(
    `Saving greeting "${message}" with timestamp: ${timestamp} for account "${accountId}"`
  );
  storage.set(accountId, message);
  storage.set(
    `${accountId}_last_updated`,
    `${new Date(timestamp / 1000000).toDateString()} ${new Date(
      timestamp / 1000000
    ).toTimeString()}`
  );
}
```

We have added two lines, first one is getting the block timestamp, which is provided in nanoseconds:

```
const timestamp = Context.blockTimestamp;
```

Seconds one convert set the storage to contains last update date of the greeting:

```
  storage.set(
    `${accountId}_last_updated`,
    `${new Date(timestamp / 1000000).toDateString()} ${new Date(
      timestamp / 1000000
    ).toTimeString()}`
  );
```

Then let's add the method to get last update value from the smart contract using the `${accountId}_last_updated` key:

```
export function getUpdateDate(accountId: string): string | null {
  return storage.get<string>(`${accountId}_last_updated`,"No custom greeting.");
}
```

### Updating React

Now let's use our new method in the React Code.

First of all we need to add them to the contract definition inside `src/utils.js`. Go and add new method `getUpdateDate` to `viewMethods` and save file so it will look like this:

![Add getUpdateDate method](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dx9aeasj3wnh3cqf7gj1.png)

Then open `src/App.js` and add a new state variable to store our update date:

```
const [updateDate, setUpdateDate] = React.useState()
```

After that inside `useEffect` hook where we are getting the greeting add one more call to get the `getLastUpdate` and when we fetch the value we can update our `updateDate` state hook by calling `setUpdateDate`. The code we add should look as following:

```
window.contract
  .getUpdateDate({ accountId: window.accountId })
  .then((greetingUpdateDate) => {
    setUpdateDate(greetingUpdateDate);
  });
```

And here how the file should look after we added those changes:

![App.js with the code](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t5jfggd69ykolzcmj4i5.png)

And the last part is to show the updateDate in the UI. Find the `h1` tag where you show current greeting and add some other tag for example `h3` after to show the last update date.

```
<h3 style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>Last Update: {updateDate}</h3>
```

Then if you open the browser you will see the default response because we have to call `setGreeting` again to save the timestamp in the smart contract storage.
So let's update the greeting and press save again, approve the transaction and when getting back we will see the date (refresh the page to see the latest changes):

![Showing update date](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1oalzdq7gr5943cdazpt.png)

Great we did it, it looks awesome, isn't it?

When you save any file in your project it is automatically rebuild and redeployed to the dev in terminal, so you should be ready to use it. If it didn't happen or you have stopped your app, just use `yarn dev` again and it will start up.

## Deploying to the GitHub Pages

The project is already set to be deployed to the Github Pages, check `package.json` for all the commands available, but to simply deploy it as is you can use `yarn deploy:pages` or to deploy everything including your smart contract you can use command `yarn deploy` which will build and deploy both the contract, and also the ui app.

But make sure to first commit and push your app to Github and also add the `homepage` property to the `package.json`. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)

## Conclusion

That's it for now, we learned how to generate a new react app connect it with the near smart contract, how to add new methods to the smart contract, and how to use them in the UI.

You can add some more methods by your own, for example add some change methods to have some custom logic for your greeting, for example return it as a reversed string, or maybe store some custom colours or font settings for the greeting in the smart contract.

The tutorial source code is accessible [here](https://github.com/oleksanderkorn/near-tutoirial) and demo app is deployed to [GithubPages](https://oleksanderkorn.github.io/near-tutorial/).
